      title: "Art for X is a way to raise money for causes by celebrating art"
      body: |
          We quickly built this website to empower artists to raise money for
          causes they find meaningful. Periodically, we will feature different
          artists sponsoring different causes.

          Right now, prints are being produced in a grassroots-style way â€“ at
          home, but with a professional, high-quality printer and paper. This
          keeps costs down to raise your maximum donation, but does require
          quite a bit of time! ðŸ™ˆ 

          As a user, you can contribute to the cause and show your support for
          the artist by buying prints and optionally making an additional
          donation.

          ### Contribute art or code

          We'd love to help you (or someone you know) raise money for a cause
          using this site. [Contribute or suggest art](/contribute/).
