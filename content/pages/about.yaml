      title: "A4X: A platform for raising money for causes and celebrating artists"
      body: |
          Periodically, we feature different artists sponsoring different
          causes. A4X allows artists to leverage their creativity and raise
          money and awareness for a cause they find meaningful.
          <br><br>
          You can contribute to both the artist and the cause by backing the
          campaign. If you raise the average contribution, you'll receive a
          bonus item.
          <br><br>
          Some campaigns will allow you to contribute an additional amount, and
          we'll send a customized hand-written letter on your behalf to
          representatives, which voices your support for the issue at hand.
          <br><br>
          In a future version of A4X, you'll be able to subscribe and receive
          notifications when new art and a new campaign is available.
